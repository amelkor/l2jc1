21.oct.2004

- attack animation is canceled properly when player moves (nuocnam)
- Target being attacked is stored internally in L2Character, so using setTarget(null)
  (notably after pressing esc key) won't cease attack. This also prevents few minor exploits 
  while changing targets quick during combat. (nuocnam)
- skill animation is canceled properly when changing target during casting 
  (not only when setting target to null) (nuocnam)
- small bugfixes in L2Character and L2PcInstance to prevent client hangups when starting 
  attack while target is not in attack range (dragon666, nuocnam)
- updatePAtk(), updateMatk(), updatePDef() and updateMDef() methods corrected. Few unused & buggy statements removed.
  Methods no longer use dummy values as defaults, but they look on values from template table. (nuocnam)
=>IMPORTANT: This WILL change players stats (notably pdef/mdef) on first recalculation.
  ALL PLAYERS SHOULD UNEQUIP & REEQUIP THEIR GEAR AFTER LOGIN ASAP TO AVOID ANY PROBLEMS!!
