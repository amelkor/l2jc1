This is the V0.3 release of L2J.<br><br>

System requirements:<br>
java JDK 1.4 or higher needs to be installed on you system.<br><br>


Before you can start up the server you need to create some
data files from the client content. To do this, just startup the convertData.bat.<br>

It will ask you for you L2 install folder, and create 5 files in the data folder. 
Now the server is ready to be started, however you also have
to adjust the client a bit so that it actually connects to
your server instead of the real ones.<br><br>

To fix this start the updateIni.bat - it will also ask you for the L2 install 
folder and the server address you want to use. You can also put a hostname in here.<br>

The tool will change your L2.ini file and make a backup of the old one. Make 
sure that the ip matches what you have configures in the server.cfg file.<br>

The accout file of version 0.1 is not compatible with this release.
You better delete the old one. Check the changes.txt to see what is new.

<br>
<b>Dont expect this to be a fully functional release.
It should be considered as a preview version.
We know that there are some bugs in it, and we know that some
things dont work at all.</b><br><br>

If you want to give feedback, please do so in our forum at <b>l2j.sourceforge.net</b>
or visit us in the IRC channel <b>#l2j on irc.eu.freenode.net</b><br><br><br>


Have fun,<br>
